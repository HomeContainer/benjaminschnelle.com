For some time I've been wanting to start a blog series with the goal of making no assumptions of prior knowledge so that even the greenest beginner can follow along.  When I was first getting started I was able to find lots of good resources on various topics, but many of them had implicit assumptions of the reader's knowledge base that could quickly turn a helpful post into a confusing one.  The series will build on topics covered in prior posts so that we may increase in complexity over time and don't have to repeat ourselves.

We'll be focused primarily on web applications and JavaScript since it can be written in the client (browser) and server (Node.js).  If you know *nothing* about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and network protocols don't worry!  At a minimum, if I don't explain something directly, I'll provide a resource which does a very good job (in my opinion) of explaining the topic.  If read in sequence you should be able to follow without issue.  Think of them as guest posts, that the other writer doesn't know they're part of!  While I would love to write about all of the topics we'll touch on, if I were to do so each post would end up being thousands of pages long which wouldn't be very practical.

If you're reading this and find something unclear, confusing, or completely incorrect please contact me so that I can make improvements.

#### What are we going to build?
We're going to first create a starter kit focused on the React ecosystem (one of the trendiest client-side libraries as of this writing).  If you think we're reinventing the wheel here, we are.  There are [many](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example), [many](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) starter kits available already, but that isn't the point.  We want to understand what they're doing and why.  We'll continue to improve our starter kit as time passes, new libraries are introduced or improved, and entirely new technologies come into existence.  I've already started compiling a list of features I'd like to add, but to start we'll [Keep it simple, Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

Once we've created our starter kit we'll move onto a simple web app to serve as my plot of land on the interwebs. It'll have some generic info about me, my resume, a blog, and a place for apps so that after we hack together that unicorn simulator we've been dreaming about we'll have somewhere to put it.  We'll host it at benjaminschnelle.com (that's me!).  

From there, who knows?

#### Getting Started
If you're new to software development, specifically the Javascript ecosystem, it can be overwhelming.  Most of the posts won't be short, quite the opposite actually so that we can elaborate on complicated topics to achieve a sufficient level of understanding.  If you actually want to learn how to build software there is a lot to learn and there's no silver bullet.  When you get frustrated take a break and get a beer (if you're allowed to).

As we go along my plan currently (it may change) is to maintain two separate repositories on GitHub for the application we'll be building.  One will be the "working" application and the other will be a refined version of the same codebase with well thought out commits and better organization overall.  The working repo will likely be rife with changes which won't make it a good reference for our posts, but if you're curious feel free to dig in.  

You're probably thinking I'm already making assumptions about your knowledge of GitHub!  In our first post we'll cover Git and GitHub in detail so you'll get a better idea of what I'm talking about.  For now, just know that a repository is a place where we can version our source code.

This post is being written from within the project we're building. Whoa.

Happy hacking and I hope I'm able to teach you something new!
