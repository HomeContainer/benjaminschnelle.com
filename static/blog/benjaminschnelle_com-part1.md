## Setup our new repo using [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/bschnelle/react-starter-kit) as our basis
We'll start this project by cloning the react-starter-kit we created in the last post.  Here we're cloning it into a new directory named "benjaminschnelle.com", `cd`ing into it, then installing our dependencies.

```bash
# change directory to wherever you want to put your project
git clone https://github.com/bschnelle/react-starter-kit.git benjaminschnelle.com
cd benjaminschnelle.com
npm install
```

## Create a GitHub 1.0.0 milestone and issues for the items below
Let's jump in, if you read the last post we went through how to create GitHub milestones and issues so you should already have to skillzzz to handle this!

## Layout component
Ok, hurrr we go.  We're taking a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach so we'll do our best to always lead with tests.
