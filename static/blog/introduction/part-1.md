Hi! I'm Ben and this is the beginning of my software engineering blog.  Initially, the focus is going to be on front-end development, but later we'll get into other things as well.

![React So Hot](../../images/react-so-hot.jpeg)

I'm really into the React ecosystem right now so that's what the first post is going to be about.  Specifically, I'm going to write about creating a starter kit from scratch.

My goal is to make no assumptions about prior knowledge and over time we'll build up to more complex topics.  When topics indirectly related to the post come up, I'll generally provide a very brief overview and/or link to additional learning material.

## Fundamentals
As a precursor to our first post, the subjects below are kind of the bare minimum you should be familiar with going in.  If you don't like the resources I've linked to just Google the topics.  There are an absurd number of free resources for learning all of these subjects.
